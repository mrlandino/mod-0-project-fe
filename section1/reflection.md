## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

   It has been engrained in my head to always google something before asking so that you make the effort to learn before you are given the gift of the answer. With that being said I like the rule they mentioned where you can research for 30 min (without progress) and then you can ask your other resources. I also like the perspective of the employer when you are wasting time trying to find an answer for hours when you can just ask your supervisor for a 2 minute response and explanation. This saves time and money to the employer.

   I feel good about asking questions when I feel that I need to.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

   The data types include: string, number, and boolean.

   * string- is letters or characters wrapped in quotes
   * number- handles numbers
   * boolean- evaluates to one of two values (true or false) similar to a yes or no


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

   ```Javascript
   console.log("Hello World!");
   ```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

   To create comments in a JavaScript file you can do 2 things

   * single line would be: `// text`
   * multi line would be: `/* text */`

   A code comment allows you to make notes or comments directly to the code without effecting the execution of the code itself. This can be used for yourself or you can use it to communicate to team members.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

   A variable is a place to store a value and be able to reference it and use it multiple times.

   An example to a 5 year old would be: Storing all of your toys in a toyBox or keeping all of your books on a bookshelf. These locations like toyBox and bookshelf are variables.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

   If we look at a site like Amazon they use variables like userName, quantity, productType, primeMember, etc..

   * userName would be a String
   * quantity would be a Number
   * productType would be a String
   * primeMember would be a Boolean

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

   Concatenation is a way to join strings and variables together to output into one string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

   If I reference Amazon again the output of an order is a concatenation. They may say "Thank you Ross for your order of 26 inch computer monitor. It will ship on January 10th. Thank you." There are multiple values and strings associated with that output string.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

   - Is it best practice to use single (' ') or double (" ") for the use of quotations?
   - When you pull from GitHub, can we do that from the terminal or do we need to use the GitHub site for that like our homework from Session 3?
