## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

   I have coached growth mindset in my athletes for the past 4 years so a lot of this was review for me. With that said, I think some of the main messages with a growth mindset is that it applies to EVERYTHING. Whether it is something brand new to you or something you have done for a long time, a growth mindset is still needed to grow and expand your current knowledge and abilities. You can also have a growth mindset is one thing and a fixed mindset in others. The goal is to be open to growing and learning with everything that you do, even if it is hard. One of the main points they mentioned that resonated with me was that there are no shortcuts to success. You have to put in the time to become good at anything.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

   I feel that I have a decent growth mindset in most of what I do now except cooking. I have a really hard time learning different ways to cook and be excited about putting in the work to feed myself that isn't take out. All other things I try to keep an open mind and student perspective that keeps me learning and growing. I WANT to learn, that is always the key to growing in any category.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

   I felt pretty good about getting less direction. I have always believed that the learning process is this methodZ: you watch and take notes, you assist in the process, and then it's on you to execute. This process can be challenging with different material that is super new to you. It will just take more time to lean on your resources. I supported my learning by using my resources (notes, google, the JS book, trial and error).

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

   A conditional statement is a set of parameters that give one answer or another similar to a yes/no, go/no go, true/false.

   A daily life conditional is whether a door is locked or not. If the door is locked you cannot enter. If the door is unlocked you may enter.

   One example of a conditional on a web application could be: did a person input something into a box in a form (yes or no). If they didn't it will give you a red warning to complete the required box. If the box is complete then you may continue.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

   Multiple conditions to an 'if' statement can be used with an 'else if' statement that follows the 'if' statement.

   The program reads the first if statement and decides if it is true or not. If the if statement returns true, then it will execute whatever code is within that if statement and thats it. If the first if statement is false, it will go to the next else if statement and repeat that process of evaluating whether it is true or not. If that else if statement is true, it will execute that code within that else if statement and thats it. You can have multiple else if statements that will execute in that order until one returns true to execute the corresponding code. The last line of code will be an else statement. If all of the if AND else if statements return false, the else statement will execute.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

   If I wanted to check if 2 conditions are met I can use a logical operator && or ||. These allow me to evaluate if both conditions are met (&&) or if one out of the two conditions are met (||). These can then be checked on my terminal through node to see how they execute with different scenarios.  

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

   I currently don't have any questions about 'if' statements or functions.
