## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

   * I felt great about implementing everything that needed to be done to answer the problems using my resources I had available.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

   * Arrays are used whenever there is a list of data that needs to be stored and used again later. An example of an Array could be a subscriber list on YouTube.  

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

   * An Array method is a piece of functionality built into javascript to manipulate the elements in an Array or the Array overall.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

   * The purpose of a loop is to repeat an action or lines of code over and over again as needed in an organized and efficient way. We could use a loop without an Array to run a certain line of code a specific number of times. When we add an Array to a loop it allows us to pull the information out of the Array one element at a time and then execute code associated with each element.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

   * A loop is how you repeat something over and over as many times as you want to.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

   * I don't have any questions about Arrays and loops at this time.
